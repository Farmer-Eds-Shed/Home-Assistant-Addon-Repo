## About
[ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) (pronounced notify) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, and/or using a REST API. It's infinitely flexible, and 100% free software. <br>

This Home Assistant addon runs a ntfy instance with default settings - see the [ntfy docs](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) for more details on usage.
